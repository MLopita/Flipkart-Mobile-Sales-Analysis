# Flipkart Mobile Data Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

### Tools Used
Microsoft Excel – Preliminary data cleaning (null handling, standardization)  
Microsoft Power BI – Data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design  

### Objective
Analyze smartphone listings from Flipkart to uncover insights into brand presence, pricing tiers, customer ratings, and discount trends.  
The goal was to support pricing and marketing strategies by visualizing competitive positioning, profit margins, and consumer preferences.  

### Project Description
This project utilizes scraped Flipkart mobile data containing 4,689 smartphone listings across 17 brands.  

Price segmentation was performed to classify phones into:  
• Low Range (< ₹10K)  
• Mid Range (₹10K–₹25K)  
• Premium (> ₹25K)  

Excel was used for initial cleaning and preprocessing.  
Power BI was used for data modeling, DAX measures (Average Rating, Avg Discount %, Profit Margin), and dashboard design with filters and visuals.
